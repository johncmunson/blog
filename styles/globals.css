/*
 * Tailwind is the primary and preferred method for authoring styles in this project,
 * and is enabled by the tailwind at-rules below. However, Next also supports global
 * styles and component-level styles.
 * https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
 *
 * Global styles are enabled by this stylesheet. You can simply add normal CSS anywhere
 * in this file. Due to the global nature of standard CSS, Next only allows .css files
 * to be imported into _app.tsx.
 * https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet
 *
 * Component-level styles are enabled by Next's built-in support for CSS Modules. Simply
 * create a .module.css file and import into your components like so...
 * import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'
 * https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css
 *
 * Next also supports Sass and CSS-in-JS, but those two approaches are discouraged by
 * this project. Tailwind should support the vast majority of styling needs, and CSS Modules
 * is the preferred backup approach in the event that tailwind isn't suitable for a particular
 * use case.
