title: "Clarifying the Role of AGENTS.md: Introducing the v1.1 Proposal"
description:
---

[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) has seen broad and growing adoption across the AI-assisted software development ecosystem. Teams are using it successfully to guide coding agents with project-specific context, conventions, and constraints. That success, however, has also surfaced a set of recurring questions and inconsistencies—most of them not about _what_ AGENTS.md is for, but about _how_ it is expected to work.

The v1.1 proposal addresses these issues directly. It does not reinvent AGENTS.md, nor does it introduce breaking changes. Instead, it makes implicit assumptions explicit, clarifies scope, and positions AGENTS.md more clearly within an evolving ecosystem of agent-facing specifications.

> Note: The formal proposal is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135

# Why Improvements Are Needed

In practice, most tools and users already agree on several core behaviors of AGENTS.md:

- Files apply to a directory and its descendants
- Guidance accumulates as agents traverse the filesystem
- More specific instructions override more general ones
- AGENTS.md primarily communicates behavioral expectations

The problem is that none of this has been clearly documented. As a result, tool authors have been forced to infer behavior, users have relied on tribal knowledge, and implementations have diverged in subtle ways. This creates friction for anyone trying to adopt AGENTS.md consistently across tools or projects.

Another concern is discoverability and scale. As projects grow and accumulate multiple AGENTS.md files, loading all guidance eagerly becomes inefficient, yet the existing specification offers little direction on progressive disclosure or indexing.

Finally, the original specification left its scope intentionally broad. While that flexibility helped early adoption, it has also introduced ambiguity—especially as adjacent specifications begin to mature.

# AGENTS.md and SKILL.md: Clarifying the Boundary

One of the most important motivations for v1.1 is ecosystem clarity.

The [SKILL.md](https://skill.md/) specification (often conceived by Anthropic as “Claude Skills”) is rapidly gaining traction as a way to describe agent **capabilities**—what an agent knows how to do, the tools it can use, and the domains it is proficient in.

AGENTS.md, by contrast, is most effective when focused on **behavior**: rules, constraints, workflows, conventions, and expectations that apply within a specific project or directory.

In its current overly broad framing, AGENTS.md can appear to overlap significantly with SKILL.md. This has led to understandable confusion about which format should be used for what purpose. The v1.1 proposal resolves this by explicitly positioning AGENTS.md as complementary to SKILL.md, not competitive with it.

In short:

- **AGENTS.md** answers: “How should an agent behave?”
- **SKILL.md** answers: “What can this agent do?”

AGENTS.md may reference skills, but it is not optimized for describing them. By clarifying intent and scope, v1.1 reduces overlap and helps both specifications coexist cleanly.

Importantly though, care has been taken to ensure that the AGENTS.md specification remains flexible enough to support the skills use case if needed. For example, if a project is only utilizing AGENTS.md and does not want to introduce an additional specification in order to describe available skills and capabilities.

# What’s New in the v1.1 Proposal

The v1.1 proposal focuses on clarification rather than expansion. Its core improvements include:

# Explicit Semantics for How Files Interact

The proposal clearly documents four concepts that were previously implicit:

- **Jurisdiction** — AGENTS.md applies to its directory and descendants only
- **Accumulation** — Guidance builds up across directory levels
- **Precedence** — More specific guidance overrides more general guidance
- **Implicit inheritance** — Child files inherit ancestor guidance by default

These rules align with how most users already expect AGENTS.md to behave; v1.1 simply makes those expectations explicit and shared.

# Optional Frontmatter for Progressive Disclosure

v1.1 introduces optional YAML frontmatter (`description` and `tags`) to support indexing and selective loading. This allows agents and harnesses to discover relevant guidance without eagerly loading every file.

Frontmatter is intentionally optional. Filesystem position remains the primary source of context, preserving simplicity and backwards compatibility.

# Clear Guidance for Implementers

The proposal adds a dedicated section for agent and harness authors, covering:

- Progressive discovery and loading
- Index formats (without mandating one)
- Compaction and summarization strategies
- The distinction between probabilistic and deterministic enforcement

This helps align implementations without constraining architectural choices.

# A Clearer Statement of Philosophy

v1.1 articulates the design principles that have guided AGENTS.md from the beginning: guidance over governance, implementation agnosticism, and pragmatic conventions that match user intuition.

# Preserving the Spirit of the Original Specification

While v1.1 adds clarity, it deliberately avoids changing the core character of AGENTS.md.

It remains:

- A lightweight, human-authored Markdown file
- Flexible in structure and content
- Focused on communication rather than enforcement
- Open and implementation-agnostic

The guiding metaphor—“a README for agents”—is unchanged. The goal is still to provide the kind of contextual guidance you would give a new teammate, not to define a rigid configuration language or policy engine.

# Backwards Compatibility by Design

All existing AGENTS.md files remain valid under v1.1.

There are no required new fields, no mandatory frontmatter, no changes to the filename, and no new structural constraints. Tools that support AGENTS.md today can continue to do so without modification.

v1.1 is additive and clarifying, not disruptive. It documents what the community is already doing, rather than asking the community to change behavior.

## Looking Ahead

As agent tooling matures, shared expectations become increasingly important. The AGENTS.md v1.1 proposal is a step toward greater alignment—between tools, between specifications, and between human intent and agent behavior.

By clarifying scope, codifying best practices, and reinforcing compatibility with emerging standards like SKILL.md, v1.1 aims to make AGENTS.md easier to adopt, easier to implement, and easier to reason about—without losing the simplicity that made it useful in the first place.
