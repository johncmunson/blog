title: "Clarifying the Role of AGENTS.md: Introducing the v1.1 Proposal"
description: "AGENTS.md v1.1 clarifies how agent guidance is scoped, inherited, and discovered—formalizing existing practice and cleanly positioning it alongside emerging specs like SKILL.md."
---

`AGENTS.md` is the OG spec for agentic behavior guidance. It's beauty lies in its simplicity. However, as adoption continues to grow, it's becoming clear that there are important edge cases that are underspecified or undocumented. While most people agree on how AGENTS.md _should_ work... very few of those implicit agreements are actually written down.

I’ve opened a **v1.1 proposal** that aims to fix this by clarifying semantics, not reinventing the format. This blog post is a summary of _why_ the proposal exists and _what_ it changes.

**Full proposal & discussion:** [https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/135)

# What’s the actual problem?

The issue isn’t that AGENTS.md lacks a purpose... it’s that **important edge cases are underspecified or undocumented**.

In real projects, users immediately run into unanswered questions:

- What happens when multiple `AGENTS.md` files conflict?
- Is the agent reading the instructions from the leaf node, ancestor nodes, or both?
- Are `AGENTS.md` files being loaded eagerly or lazily?
- Are files being loaded in a deterministic or probabilistic manner?
- What happens to `AGENTS.md` instructions during context compaction or summarization?

Because the spec is largely silent, **users are left guessing how their instructions are actually interpreted**. Two tools can both claim “AGENTS.md support” while behaving differently in subtle but important ways.

End users deserve a shared mental model to rely on. They deserve to feel confident that when using Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other agentic tool that claims to support `AGENTS.md`, that the agents will all generally have the same shared understanding of what the behaviorial expectations are for handling `AGENTS.md` files.

# AGENTS.md vs SKILL.md

A major motivation for v1.1 is reducing confusion with [SKILL.md](https://agentskills.io/home) (aka “Claude Skills”).

The distinction this proposal makes explicit:

- **AGENTS.md** → _How should the agent behave?_ (rules, constraints, workflows, conventions)
- **SKILL.md** → _What can this agent do?_ (capabilities, tools, domains)

Right now AGENTS.md is framed broadly enough that it _appears_ to overlap with SKILL.md. The developer community does not benefit from this overlap and the potential confusion it creates.

v1.1 positions them as **complementary, not competing**:

- AGENTS.md focuses on behavior
- SKILL.md focuses on capability
- AGENTS.md can reference skills, but isn’t optimized to define them

Importantly, the proposal still keeps AGENTS.md flexible enough to where it can technically support the skills use case if needed. For example, if a project is only utilizing AGENTS.md and does not want to introduce an additional specification in order to describe available skills and capabilities.

# What v1.1 actually changes (high-level)

# 1. Makes implicit filesystem semantics explicit

The proposal formally documents four concepts most tools already assume:

- **Jurisdiction** – applies to the directory and descendants
- **Accumulation** – guidance stacks across directory levels
- **Precedence** – closer files override higher-level ones
- **Implicit inheritance** – child scopes inherit from ancestors by default

No breaking changes, just formalizing shared expectations.

# 2. Optional frontmatter for discoverability (not configuration)

v1.1 introduces **optional** YAML frontmatter fields:

- `description`
- `tags`

These are meant for:

- Indexing
- Progressive disclosure, as pioneered by Claude Skills
- Large-repo scalability

Filesystem position remains the primary scoping mechanism. Frontmatter is additive and fully backwards-compatible.

# 3. Clear guidance for tool and harness authors

There’s now a dedicated section covering:

- Progressive discovery vs eager loading
- Indexing (without mandating a format)
- Summarization / compaction strategies
- Deterministic vs probabilistic enforcement

This helps align implementations without constraining architecture.

# 4. A clearer statement of philosophy

The proposal explicitly states what AGENTS.md _is_ and _is not_:

- Guidance, not governance
- Communication, not enforcement
- README-like, not a policy engine
- Human-authored, implementation-agnostic Markdown

The original spirit stays intact.

# What doesn’t change

- No new required fields
- No mandatory frontmatter
- No filename changes
- No structural constraints
- All existing AGENTS.md files remain valid

v1.1 is **clarifying and additive**, not disruptive.

# Why I’m posting this here

If you:

- Maintain an agent harness
- Build AI-assisted dev tools
- Use AGENTS.md in real projects
- Care about spec drift and ecosystem alignment

...feedback now is much cheaper than divergence later.

I’m especially interested in whether or not this proposal...

- Strikes the right balance between clarity, simplicity, and flexibility
- Successfully creates a shared mental model for end users
- Aligns with the spirit of the original specification
- Avoids burdening tool authors with overly prescriptive requirements
- Establishes a fair contract between tool authors, end users, and agents
- Adequately clarifies scope and disambiguates from other related specifications like SKILL.md
- Is a net positive for the ecosystem
