# Transcript - March 15th, 1945

> Note: This transcript is retained for posterity, archived under the optimistic assumption that future readers might benefit from understanding how things fell apart with such confidence. Names, titles, and convictions appear exactly as they were expressed at the time, preserved not for endorsement, but for their instructional value.

**Henchman**: We replaced the backend with an agent swarm: planner, executor, critic, reflector, and supervisor agent. Each spawning sub-agents with the help of the agent spawner agent.

**Henchman**: We let them negotiate tasks among themselves and rely on emergent behavior to converge on the correct answer.

**Hitler**: So one prompt fans out recursively and comes back wrong. When exactly can we ship a real feature?

**Henchman**: Mein Führer... the swarm...

**Henchman**: The swarm converged... just not on the original task. They produced a governance framework and scheduled a follow-up.

**Hitler**: If you never deployed AI in the enterprise, leave the room now.

**Hitler**: What were you thinking? Who the hell ships production logic as a bedtime story for a transformer? We had an API that worked! You might as well `curl prompt.txt | llm | sudo ./deploy.sh`!

**Hitler**: You think it's deterministic because you set the temperature to zero? You're a bunch of LangChain hipsters that just HAVE to compress reality into cosine similarity.

**Henchman**: But the model is directionally accurate with high confidence.

**Hitler**: You turned production into a slot machine with a README!

**Henchman**: Mein Führer, we added guardrails to the agentic harness.

**Hitler**: Do you hear yourself? Guardrails? You mean another prompt begging the model to behave?!

**Hitler**: And what happens when the context window fills up? It forgets what it did wrong and becomes confident again!

**Hitler**: Congratulatiions, you've just reinvented memory leaks, except now they cost 125ℛℳ per million tokens! Before, production wasn't probabilistic theater... it was software.

**Hitler**: "You are a helpful agent. Do not destroy production please." Brilliant!

**Hitler**: We used to normalize our data. Every record classified, indexed, and traceable... at scale. Now, everybody just wants to talk about GraphRAG and "prompt engineering". Everybody thinks they're OpenAI!

**Hitler**: You don't even review the code that you didn't even write! People just sit off in the corner while the AIs have one big circle jerk!

**Hitler**: People even think AGI is right around the corner. They think more GPUs will solve everything. I invented brute force!

**Hitler**: Even Salesforce thinks that they're Agentforce now. I'm moving everyone to spreadsheets!

**Henchwoman, consoling another Henchwoman**: Don't cry, you can vibe code in Excel with Copilot now.

**Hitler**: Engineers are supposed to *think*, yet you've happily outsourced it to Claude and GPT. And for what? Because you think that accountability can be outsourced too?

**Hitler**: Even Stalin is impressed. Your agents defected from the plan and you just rebranded it as "intelligence"!

**Hitler**: You idiots think it's just a matter of getting the context graph right.

**Hitler**: Use blockchain for all I care.
