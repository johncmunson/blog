title: Lemme Tell You Something About My Homie Nate
description: He's a pretty cool guy.

He's an awesome guy. Like, one of the most selfless people I've ever met. For as long as we've been friends, which started back in the first week of college 2010, he has always gone out of his way to keep in touch and maintain our relationship, even though I am just so terrible at that sometimes.

Just this morning, a random package showed up on my doorstep. "What could this be?", I says to myself. Of course, it's a dope vinyl from Nate. Granted, he probably has three copies of this album already (Nate's the biggest Washed Out fan I know of), but honestly that made my whole day.

If you happen to be in the Kansas City area and you have an interest in anything and everything related to retro gaming, Nate organizes [one of the coolest game cons around](https://www.kansascityretro.com/). I've been the past several years and it's a blast every time. And if you run into Nate, be sure to tell him he's a pretty cool guy.
