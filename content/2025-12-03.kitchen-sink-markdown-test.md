# Kitchen Sink Markdown Test

This post flexes **bold**, _italic_, `inline code`, ~~retired ideas~~, and even **_bold italics_** all in one breath. It also proves that emoji shortcodes like :tada: render, @octocat mentions stay intact, and raw links such as <https://github.com> or internal ones like [/rss.xml](/rss.xml) behave as expected—footnotes included[^footnote-basics].

## Basic Styling

Paragraphs wrap naturally across multiple sentences, and automatic heading anchors mean you can [jump back up](#kitchen-sink-markdown-test) whenever needed. Footnotes travel with the paragraph[^syntax-engine], and emphasis can be mixed: **_bold italics_**. Need a line break?<br/>Just drop in an HTML `<br/>`.

## Lists On Lists

1. Numbered lists sort themselves.
   1. Nested ordered items keep their own counts.
   2. Continue as long as needed.
2. Start values do not matter; Markdown normalizes them.

- Bullets can mix with ordered lists.
  - Sub-bullets display indented content.
    - Third-level bullets work too.
- List items can host `inline code`, **emphasis**, or links.

## Task Board

- [x] Render headings, paragraphs, and emphasis
- [x] Showcase lists, tables, and blockquotes
- [ ] Leave something unchecked for the demo

## Quotable Callouts

> ### Pull Quote
>
> Blockquotes support headings, paragraphs, and lists.
>
> - Treat them like mini callouts.
> - Bring attention to important context.
>
> > Nested quotes are possible when you need to cite someone citing someone else.

## Tabular Data

| Alignment     | Markdown Example | Notes |
| :------------ | :--------------: | ----: |
| Left aligned  |    `*italic*`    |   123 |
| Centered      |    `**bold**`    |   456 |
| Right aligned |   `~~strike~~`   |   789 |

Tables accept inline formatting, code spans, and numeric columns with alignment cues thanks to GFM.

## Image Showcase

Images include their dimensions automatically via `remark-image-size`, so Next/Image knows exactly how to render them.

## Syntax Highlighting

Shiki powers fenced code blocks. You get themed output in light and dark mode without any extra work.

```ts
interface Feature {
  name: string;
  enabled: boolean;
}

const features: Feature[] = [
  { name: "markdown", enabled: true },
  { name: "gfm", enabled: true },
];

export function isEnabled(name: string) {
  return features.some((feature) => feature.name === name && feature.enabled);
}
```

```diff
- const theme = "plain";
+ const theme = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "one-light" : "one-dark-pro";
```

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## Bonus Details

<details>
<summary>Expandable content proves HTML passthrough works</summary>

Here you can mix **Markdown** _inside_ the `<details>` element, add lists, or even drop another code span like `details-open` for future automation hooks.

Need an internal anchor reference? [Jump to Syntax](#syntax-highlighting) or hop to the [Task Board](#task-board). Everything above exists to show how confident the pipeline is when rendering the real posts that follow.

[^footnote-basics]: Footnotes render at the bottom of the page with automatic backlinks.
[^syntax-engine]: Footnote references can live anywhere inside a paragraph and still resolve.
