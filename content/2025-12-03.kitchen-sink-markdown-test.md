title: Kitchen Sink Markdown Test
---

This post flexes **bold**, _italic_, `inline code`, ~~retired ideas~~, and even **_bold italics_** all in one breath. It also proves that the remark-gfm extras—autolink literals, strikethrough, tables, task lists, and footnotes—render exactly the way the pipeline promises. Raw links such as https://github.com or internal ones like [/rss.xml](/rss.xml) just work, and the footnotes stay glued to their references[^footnote-basics].

> **Heading tip:** The markdown pipeline coerces every heading element into an `<h2>` on render. To keep authoring simple, always write headings as `# Heading text` and let the pipeline normalize them.

# Heading Behavior

Every section below intentionally starts with `#` so the source markdown is easy to scan. When rendered, each heading (no matter the authored depth) becomes an `<h2>` with an auto-linked anchor thanks to `rehype-slug` and `rehype-autolink-headings`.

# Basic Styling

Paragraphs wrap naturally across multiple sentences, and automatic anchors mean you can [jump back up](#kitchen-sink-markdown-test) whenever needed. Footnotes travel with the paragraph[^syntax-engine], and emphasis can be mixed: **_bold italics_**.

Line breaks can be achieved with two trailing spaces at the end of a line  
like this.

You can also end a line with a backslash for the same effect\
like this.

# Lists On Lists

1. Numbered lists sort themselves.
   1. Nested ordered items keep their own counts.
   2. Continue as long as needed.
2. Start values do not matter; Markdown normalizes them.
   - Bullets can mix with ordered lists.
     - Sub-bullets display indented content.
       - Fourth-level bullets work too.
   - List items can host `inline code`, **emphasis**, or [links](https://google.com).

# Task Board

- [x] Render headings, paragraphs, and emphasis
- [x] Showcase lists, tables, and blockquotes
- [ ] Leave something unchecked for the demo

# Quotable Callouts

> Blockquotes support paragraphs, lists, and more.
>
> - Treat them like mini callouts.
> - Bring attention to important context.
>
> > Nested quotes are possible when you need to cite someone citing someone else.

# Tabular Data

| Column Alignment | Markdown Example | Notes (Right Aligned) |
| :--------------- | :--------------: | --------------------: |
| Left aligned     |    `*italic*`    |                   123 |
| Centered         |    `**bold**`    |                   456 |
| Right aligned    |   `~~strike~~`   |                   789 |

The header alignment markers (`:--`, `:--:`, `--:`) demonstrate left, center, and right alignment respectively, so the first column explains what you are seeing, the middle column shows inline formatting, and the final column highlights numeric values hugging the right edge.

# Image Showcase

Images include their dimensions automatically via `remark-image-size`, so Next/Image knows exactly how to render them.

# Syntax Highlighting

Shiki powers fenced code blocks. You get themed output in light and dark mode without any extra work.

```ts
interface Feature {
  name: string;
  enabled: boolean;
}

const features: Feature[] = [
  { name: "markdown", enabled: true },
  { name: "gfm", enabled: true },
];

export function isEnabled(name: string) {
  return features.some((feature) => feature.name === name && feature.enabled);
}
```

```diff
- const theme = "plain";
+ const theme = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "one-light" : "one-dark-pro";
```

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

# Bonus Details

<details>
<summary>Expandable content proves HTML passthrough works</summary>

Here you can mix **Markdown** inside the `<details>` element, add lists, or even drop another code span like `details-open` for future automation hooks.

- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested bullet just to show it off

1.  Ordered items render too
2.  Mix and match anything you like

</details>

Need an internal anchor reference? [Jump to Syntax](#syntax-highlighting) or hop to the [Task Board](#task-board). Everything above exists to show how confident the pipeline is when rendering the real posts that follow.

[^footnote-basics]: Footnotes render at the bottom of the page with automatic backlinks.
[^syntax-engine]: Footnote references can live anywhere inside a paragraph and still resolve.
