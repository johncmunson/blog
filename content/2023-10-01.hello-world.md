# Markdown Kitchen Sink 🧰

Welcome to the all-singing, all-dancing Hello World post. This document showcases most of what plain Markdown and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) can accomplish inside this blog. Grab a snack, scroll around, and steal whatever patterns you need.

Need a TL;DR? Skip to the [Quick Reference](#quick-reference) or browse the [media gallery](#media-gallery) below.

# Paragraphs & Emphasis

Multiple paragraphs keep thoughts organized. You can _italicize_, **bold**, combine **_both_**, or deploy ~~strikethrough~~ for edits. Inline code like `const hello = "world";` draws attention to syntax, while automatic links such as https://nextjs.org appear without extra fuss.

### Lists You Can Nest

- Bullet lists explain things succinctly.
  - Sub-bullets let you dive deeper.
  - Mix and match text, `inline code`, and **emphasis**.
- Task lists double as simple checklists:
  - [x] Write the Hello World post
  - [ ] Ship it to production

1. Ordered lists keep steps clear.
2. They can include paragraphs, links, and even multi-line content.
3. Combine them with sublists for detailed procedures.

## Media Gallery

![Happy doggo ready for a walk](/doggo.png)

Both images live in `public/` and demonstrate how straightforward it is to embed assets.

## Code Blocks & Syntax Highlighting

```tsx
export default function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return (
    <section className="card">
      <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>
      <p>This snippet proves fenced code blocks support JSX/TSX.</p>
    </section>
  );
}
```

GitHub-style diff blocks work too:

```diff
- const theme = "light";
+ const theme = prefersDarkMode ? "dark" : "light";
```

## Quick Reference

| Feature    | Example                         | Notes                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Headings   | `#`, `##`, `###`                | Use to structure long posts.         |
| Emphasis   | `_italic_`, `**bold**`          | Combine for stylistic flair.         |
| Links      | `[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)` | Autolinks also supported.            |
| Images     | `![alt](path)`                  | See the kitty-cat and doggo above.   |
| Code       | `` `inline` `` / fenced blocks  | Triple backticks for multi-line.     |
| Task Lists | `- [x] done`                    | Render as checkboxes.                |
| Tables     | Pipes + dashes                  | Align columns with colons if needed. |

## Extras & Footnotes

Emojis add flavor :sparkles:. Definition-style formatting also works:

Term
: Definition text indented inside a paragraph.

Horizontal rules create clear breaks:

Footnotes survive the static site pipeline. Here is one in action.[^gfm]

[^gfm]: This footnote shows that GFM extras (like tables, task lists, and strikethrough) render correctly.
