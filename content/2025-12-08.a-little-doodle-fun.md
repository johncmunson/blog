title: A Little Doodle Fun
---

My friend Katelyn drew a cute little dinosaur doodle on my fridge whiteboard when I wasn't paying attention.

When her birthday rolled around, I thought it'd be fun to turn this doodle into some dinasaur wrapping paper and use it for her gift. And I think it's some pretty dope wrapping paper indeed. So if you have any kiddos or friends who like dinosaurs, you should definitely steal this. ESPECIALLY if this is [the gift](https://tinyurl.com/t-rex-toy) you are getting.
